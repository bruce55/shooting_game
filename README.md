#Final Project for Drawing on the Web & Python for Application
##Intro
This is a unified project for two courses. Or actually it's two projects running by themselves and communicating with each other using Socket.io.

The main idea is to create a multiplayer game that has a central server doing almost all the calculations, while clients act as a representation layer and interaction layer. 

The project currently fulfills two courses' requirements for the final project, but is still incomplete, and should be completed by May 7th.
##Installation
Python 3 (tested on 3.5) is required to run the project. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python libraries.

After all these steps, run `runserver.py` to start the server. The access address is in the server window.

##Todo
* Scoring
* fill the interaction code in collision detection
* User interface with score and ranking board
